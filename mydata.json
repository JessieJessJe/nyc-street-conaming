    "reason": "Harriet Tubman was born Harriet Ross in Dorchester County, Maryland in 1820. Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5. Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts. In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman's cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister. Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason-Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet's trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister's family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York. By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves. With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled \u201cScenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman\u201d, published in 1869 were a great financial help. In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died of pneumonia. She was 93 years old. Harriet Tubman was not afraid to fight for the rights of African-Americans. Her story is one of dedication and inspiration. During her lifetime Harriet was honored by many people. In 1897, her bravery even inspired Queen Victoria to award her a silver medal. ",

    "reason": "Amadou Diallo was born on September 2, 1975 in the village of Sinoe, Liberia, West Africa. He was the first of four children born to Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo. Amadou has one sister, Laouratou, and two brothers, Ibrahima and Abdul Salaam. Because his father, Saikou, was a businessman, Amadou traveled throughout much of his childhood living in Togo, Guinea, the homeland of his parents, Bangkok and Singapore.Amadou grew up with a love of reading, music, dancing and sports. Once in the United States, he became an avid basketball fan, in particular, of Michael Jordan. In fact, Amadou was such a true Michael Jordan fan that he shifted from a Bulls fan to a Knicks fan when Jordan had decided to retire.Amadou had a passion for school and attended some of the finest schools in the world, including The French International School, London's Cambridge University, The British Consulate College in Thailand and the Asian Institute of Microsoft. It was Amadou's dream to one day enroll in school in the United States. At twenty, he decided to come to America to continue his computer education and he wanted to do it on his own. In September of 1996, he decided to come to New York to start a business with his cousin. His father, Saikou, was reluctant at first but later relented after he was reassured by relatives that Amadou would be taken care of. Upon his arrival in New York, he first worked as a delivery man but later became a street peddler selling gloves, socks and video tapes in Manhattan on 14th Street. He worked six days a week, 12 hours a day. However, his dream to pursue his education in America continued. A young man from Senegal who met Amadou in New York fondly recalls the times he and Amadou would sit talking for hours about school. After class, he'd stop by Amadou's stand where Amadou would always have a cold bottle of apple juice waiting for him. He'd take his usual seat while Amadou would run down his usual questions; \"So tell me, how was school in America today? How do you feel about being in the classroom?\" He'd get so excited just listening and, at the end of every conversation, he'd say, \"You know, I'm really going to go to school here someday.\"A spiritual person, when Amadou was about 18 years old, he began to focus and collect books on his religion, studying the Koran and praying five times a day in the Muslim tradition. When the family came to collect Amadou's belongings after his death, they found solace in what they discovered. Among the many things they found were writings where Amadou had begun to research the prophets. He had written the names of all the prophets along with the dates of their birth. He had highlighted passages in the Koran that spoke about the dialogues between Christians and Muslims. Amadou was on a spiritual journey.Amadou was killed on February 4, 1999, after midnight, by four New York City police officers from the Street Crime Unit. Amadou had come home from work to his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview Section of the Bronx and decided to go back out to get something to eat. Upon his return, he encountered the police officers who ultimately fired a fuselage of 41 shots, 19 of which riddled his body. Amadou died in the vestibule of his apartment building.",

    "location": "75th Street and Shore Road, Brooklyn, NY",
    "reason": "Bobby Bello was born and raised in Bay Ridge. The youngest of nine children, he was born on June 4, 1927 to Tony and Netti Bello. He attended P.S. 105, Pershing Junior High School and graduated from Fort Hamilton High School in 1945. After high school he served in the Air Force for two years. Bobby was a member of the Local #40 Iron Works union for the next forty years. He worked on various projects in the New York City area, among them the Twin Towers and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. This brought him a sense of great pride and joy, especially when connecting his beloved Bay Ridge with his new home Staten Island.In 1952 at a Father Strype fund raising dance Bob met and later fell in love with Margaret Moakler. Two years later on October 16, 1954 in the upper church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Bob and Margie were married by her brother Father Michael Moakler. Together they had five children, Bonnie, Robert, Phillip, Stephen, and Toniann.In 1973, Bob was laid up suffering from a back injury. At that time he encouraged Maggie to go to college. Four years later she graduated with honors from Richmond College. Later, again with his encouragement, she would also acquire her Masters Degree from Saint John\u2019s University. In the year 2000 she retired from Saint Patrick\u2019s School after teaching the second grade for twenty years.Bob\u2019s chosen sport was football. As a little boy on 7th avenue and 59th street, his dream was to be a good football player. He\u2019d often reminiscence about his days at the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d field. How he took old newspapers, rolled them together tightly, wrapped them with string or rubber bands and call that his football. He would take his \u201cball\u201d to the Dust Bowl, throw the ball down the field, run back and catch it. Bob would be there for hours learning to \u201crun and catch\u201d. Since Fort Hamilton did not have a football team, Bob played with the local sand lot teams, such as The Hawks, The Imps, and the Bay Ridge Celtics where he was both a player and a coach. One year he played semi-pro football for the Indians. The last game he played was on his endeared Shore Road Football field, he was 38 years old.Bob\u2019s coaching abilities were becoming well known in Bay Ridge. In 1955, Bob, together with the youth officer Ray Rupelli, of the 64th precinct located then on the corner of 86th street and 5th avenue, began the \u201cPolice Athletic League\u201d (P.A.L.), which till this day still flourishes under the title of 68th precinct Youth Council. At the time he was also coaching in the Pop Warner Football League. The games were played on their home field at Shore Road and 79th street. Ironically enough, this field at 79th street and Shore Road is now the home field of the Xaverian Clippers Football team which is coached by Dom Laurendi, who was one of Bob\u2019s early ball players. He coached and nurtured thousands of young boys through out those years, and one outstanding young man was the New York Jets John Dockery. Over the years John never forgot his \u201ccoach,\u201d Bobby Bello. Later, Bob opened a sporting goods store on 77th street and 5th avenue and many of his \u201ckids\u201d, now mature young men, would stop by to recall the good times they had with the P.A.L. John Dockery was one of these \u201ckids.\u201d Bob was proud to know that his Bay Ridge local boy had won an athletic scholarship to Harvard University. Dockery also won a Superbowl Ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shortly afterwards, Joe Namath and Dockery joined forces and began the \u201cJoe Namath and John Dockery Football Camp\u201d. Bob was one of the first coaches to join the camp. Further more, he was a part of that camp up to the time of his death, some 27 years in all.Bob\u2019s world of coaching took him down many paths and to many fields as he coached New York Police Department Football teams, numerous high school teams such as, Tilden, Monsignor Farrell, and Tottenville High School. In 1992 the New York Finest were the champs in the Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Association Fun City Bowl in Florida, and in 1997, the Tottenville \u201cpirates\u201d were the New York City P.S.A.L. Champions. On both Occasions he received a ring in his name, a dream come true. He was very proud of these rings and \u201cHis\u201d boys. With all the devotion and hard work that he gave to his coaching, one would think that coaching was his first love. But this was not the case.Bobby Bello\u2019s first and heartfelt love belonged to his family. His wife Margie, their five children, eight grandchildren, his brothers and sisters, and their children. He felt proud to have coached his sons Robert, Phillip, and Stephen, his nephews Michael, Robert, Joseph, and later his son Joseph the III, and then his grandsons Robert and Sean. This for Bob was a joyful accomplishment. Bobby Bello\u2019s football days started alone on the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d field, but his accomplishments, his achievements, and his adulation began on the fields of Shore Road. Bobby Bello died on February 16, 1999.Bobby was not only a great football player and coach, but he was an exceptional, outstanding and magnificent man. A man whose name will give honor and due respect to this field.",

    "coname": "Father Michael J. McGivney Way",
    "location": "86th Street and 14th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY",
    "reason": "Father Michael McGivney was born in Waterbury on August 12, 1852. The oldest of thirteen children of Irish immigrants Patrick and Mary (Lynch) McGivney, Michael learned early about sorrow, the harsh grip of poverty, love and faith, and family fortitude. Six of his siblings died in infancy or childhood. At the age of 13 he left school to work in a spoon-making department of a brass factory to provide a few more dollars for family survival. When he reached the age of sixteen, he traveled to Quebec, Canada with his Waterbury pastor and registered at the French-run College of St. Hyacinthe. With the priesthood clearly in mind, he worked hard on subjects that would prepare him to apply for seminary admission. He studied two additional years at Our Lady of Angels Seminary in Niagra Falls, New York. He then moved to Montreal to attend seminary classes at the Jesuit-run St. Mary's College. When his father died in June of 1873, he went home for the funeral concerned for his family's welfare, lingering awhile in Waterbury. Then, at the request of the bishop of Hartford, he entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. On December 22, 1877, he was ordained in Baltimore's historic Cathedral of the Assumption by Archbishop (later Cardinal) James Gibbons. A few days later, he said his first Mass at Immaculate Conception Church in Waterbury. Father McGivney began his priestly ministry on Christmas Day in 1877 as curate at St. Mary's Church in New Haven. It was the city's first parish. A new stone church had been built, after the old one burned, on one of New Haven's finest residential Streets, Hillhouse Avenue. There was neighborhood objection which even the New York Times noted in 1879, under the headline: \"How An Aristocratic Avenue Was Blemished By A Roman Church Edifice.\" So Father McGivney's priestly ministry in New Haven began with tension and defensiveness among the working-class Irish families he served. Father McGivney worked closely with the young people of St. Mary's parish, holding catechism classes and organizing a total abstinence society to fight alcoholism. In 1881 he began to explore with various laymen the idea of a Catholic, fraternal benefit society. In an era when parish clubs and fraternal societies had wide popular appeal, the young priest felt there should be some way to strengthen religious faith and at the same time provide for the financial needs of families overwhelmed by illness or death of the breadwinner. He discussed this concept with Bishop Lawrence McMahon of Hartford, and received his approval. He traveled to Boston to talk with the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters, and traveled to Brooklyn to consult the Catholic Benevolent Legion. He met with other priests of the diocese. Wherever he could, he sought information that would help the Catholic laymen to organize themselves into a benefit society. William Geary, one of the Order's charter members, said that at the first council meeting in 1882, he was \"acclaimed as founder by 24 men with hearts full of joy and thanksgiving, recognizing that without his optimism, his will to succeed, his counsel and advice they would have failed.\" Father McGivney had suggested Sons of Columbus as a name for the Order. This would bind Catholicism and Americanism together through the faith and bold vision of the New World's discoverer. The word \"knights\" replaced \"sons\" because key members of the organizing group who were Irish-born Civil War veterans felt it would help to apply a noble ritual in support of the emerging cause of Catholic civil liberty. In the first public reference to the Order on February 8, 1882, the New Haven Morning Journal and Courier said the Knights of Columbus' initial meeting had been held the night before. On March 29, the Connecticut legislature granted a charter to the Knights of Columbus, formally establishing it as a legal corporation. The Order's principles in 1882 were \"Unity\" and \"Charity.\" The concepts of \"Fraternity\" and \"Patriotism\" were added later. Each of these ideals played a major role in ceremonials from the beginning. The Columbus-linked themes, says historian Christopher J. Kauffman, \"reverberated with pride in the American promise of liberty, equality and opportunity.\" In April of 1882, Father McGivney, with the permission of Bishop McMahon, wrote to all the pastors of the Diocese of Hartford. The Order's primary objective, he wrote, was to dissuade Catholics from joining secret societies by providing them better advantages at times of death or sickness. He urged each pastor to exert influence \"in the formation of a Council in your parish.\" Father McGivney personally installed the first officers of San Salvador Council No. 1 in New Haven, in May of 1882. By May 1883, Council No. 2 had been instituted in Meriden, Connecticut and Bishop McMahon, so impressed with the organization, became a member of Council No. 11 in 1884, and served it as council chaplain. By the end of 1885, there were 31 councils in Connecticut. Father McGivney's dedication to the Order was evidenced in trips he made to all parts of Connecticut and in handwritten correspondence\u2014little of which survives\u2014about K of C business. At St. Mary's, despite all this, he remained the energetic curate with constant concern for every parishioner's problems. Then in November of 1884, he was named pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston, Connecticut, a factory town 10 miles from his hometown. It was a factory parish, heavily in debt, serving working-class parishioners with few resources beyond their faith. With prayerful acceptance, Father McGivney put his seven years at St. Mary's behind him. His New Haven parishioners, in a testimonial resolution elaborately superimposed on the drawing of a chalice and host, declared that despite burdens and afflictions, his courtesy, his kindness and the purity of his life had \"secured the love and confidence of the people of St. Mary's, which will follow him in every future field of labor.\" In six subsequent years at St. Thomas, he wrestled with the church debt and built the same close ties of devotion and charitable concern he had developed in New Haven. He continued, as well, to serve as supreme chaplain, personally involved in helping the Order to extend its membership into Rhode Island. Later, from 1901 to 1939, his younger brothers, Msgrs. Patrick and John J. McGivney, served the Order as supreme chaplains. Never robust in health, Father McGivney was suddenly stricken with a serious case of pneumonia in January 1890. It hung on. Various treatments for consumptive illness were tried, but his decline persisted. The young priest lost physical strength just as the Order he founded was moving toward new vitality. On August 14, 1890, Father Michael J. McGivney died at the age of 38. In his 13 brief, busy years as a priest, Father McGivney's piety and compassion had won the love of those he served as curate and pastor. His Christian inspiration, leadership and administrative drive had brought him the loyalty and affection of thousands who knew him as the founder of the Knights of Columbus",

His professional life began in 1972, with the authorship of La Casita (The Little House), which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas. This piece became such a great success that it inspired the budding author to launch his career as a performer and composer, work that kept him busy for the rest of his life. In the 1970s, his dissatisfaction with domestic politics and economic policies in the Dominican Republic, added to increasing international turmoil, inspired him to write songs with social and political content as his aesthetic compass. Mr. V\u00edctor also took part in the movement opposed to the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and he began to write protest songs. As a young man he traveled the country as part of youth groups protesting the government while receiving an education in local rhythms. Between 1973 and 1978, he founded and led the group Nueva Fortuna, with which he traveled all over the country. In 1978, he created the group Flamboy\u00e1n, through which he projected his music as a sample of rhythmic intermixing. For five years he shared the stage with the most important figures of the Latin American song and performed in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Italy. Victor Victor studied the musical roots of merengue and bachata, recreated the genre and enriched it. Successes such as \u201cMesita de noche\u201d, \u201cAndo buscando un amor\u201d y \u201cAs\u00ed es mi amor\u201d were made with simplicity and beautiful metaphors and have been performed by leading Dominican and foreign vocalists. In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled \u201cUn chin de veneno\u201d, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled \u201c\u00c1lbum rojo\u201d, \u201cFlamboyan\u201d, \u201cCon sus flores y sus vainas\u201d, \u201cCotidiano\u201d, \u201cArtistas por la paz\u201d, \u201cInspiraciones\u201d, \u201cTu coraz\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cAlma de Barrio\u201d. In 2007, he recorded the social-themed album \u201cVerde y negro\u201d as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the Dominican Republic. Victor died of COVID-19 at a hospital in Santo Domingo at age 71. The artist was awarded the Awards: Premios A Lo Nuestro, Aplauso 92, Ronda, ACE, Aplauso 98, ASCAP and ONDA. Victor Victor remains a beloved and influential artist for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans in New York City.",
