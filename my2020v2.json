His goal was to teach residents how to help themselves, so that immigrants could create a fruitful, sustainable, and equitable livelihood. In 1998, the federally financed Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone provided his organization with a $750,000 revolving loan to fund commercial development within Community Board 12.

His professional life began in 1972, with the authorship of La Casita (The Little House), which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas. This piece became such a great success that it inspired the budding author to launch his career as a performer and composer, work that kept him busy for the rest of his life. In the 1970s, his dissatisfaction with domestic politics and economic policies in the Dominican Republic, added to increasing international turmoil, inspired him to write songs with social and political content as his aesthetic compass. Mr. V\u00edctor also took part in the movement opposed to the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and he began to write protest songs. As a young man he traveled the country as part of youth groups protesting the government while receiving an education in local rhythms. Between 1973 and 1978, he founded and led the group Nueva Fortuna, with which he traveled all over the country. In 1978, he created the group Flamboy\u00e1n, through which he projected his music as a sample of rhythmic intermixing. For five years he shared the stage with the most important figures of the Latin American song and performed in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Italy. Victor Victor studied the musical roots of merengue and bachata, recreated the genre and enriched it. Successes such as \u201cMesita de noche\u201d, \u201cAndo buscando un amor\u201d y \u201cAs\u00ed es mi amor\u201d were made with simplicity and beautiful metaphors and have been performed by leading Dominican and foreign vocalists. In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled \u201cUn chin de veneno\u201d, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled \u201c\u00c1lbum rojo\u201d, \u201cFlamboyan\u201d, \u201cCon sus flores y sus vainas\u201d, \u201cCotidiano\u201d, \u201cArtistas por la paz\u201d, \u201cInspiraciones\u201d, \u201cTu coraz\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cAlma de Barrio\u201d. In 2007, he recorded the social-themed album \u201cVerde y negro\u201d as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the Dominican Republic. Victor died of COVID-19 at a hospital in Santo Domingo at age 71. The artist was awarded the Awards: Premios A Lo Nuestro, Aplauso 92, Ronda, ACE, Aplauso 98, ASCAP and ONDA. Victor Victor remains a beloved and influential artist for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans in New York City.",

During that time he participated in securing the city of Metz, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. For his service, he received seven medals, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star.  He was later awarded the French Legion of Honor as well. After the war, Gasparre returned to Astoria, where he started a family and took a job with the U.S. Postal Service. In 1964, he took a second job with the New York Mets at the recently-opened Shea Stadium and during his 55 years as an usher, witnessed two World Series victories, the legendary concert by the Beatles, and a visit from the Pope. Although he grew up a Yankees fan (and was once even quizzed on baseball and the Yankees to prove he was an American soldier), he became one of the most familiar, beloved faces at Shea Stadium and Citi Field.",
