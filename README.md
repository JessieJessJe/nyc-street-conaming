## About


What’s the most commonly used street name in the US? It's [Second Street](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-street-name-in-america/), where Main Street splits the counts of the First. 

Street names are how we recognize and navigate around the physical spaces. They also manifest the intangibles, the local, historical, cultural, or political legacies of spaces.

We are what we remember. [NYC honorary street names](http://www.nycstreets.info/), or co-names by the City Council, are one way local activists, communities, and politicians lean on to honor people from a particular community or neighborhood who are of special significance to them. An intersection, corner, or a small portion of a street will be selected to name after each honoree. 

Hundreds of locations throughout the five boroughs have honorific names, in remembrance of people such as the ice cream vendor who brought joy to the kids and served the neighborhood for decades; Dorothy Maynor, one of the most highly praised singers of the 1940’s and 1950’s and the first African American on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera; and tragically, victims of violence especially from the 9/11 attack. 

Simultaneously, we are mapping a city of memory based on its infrastructure and grid system, interweaving its past, present, and future. All the incidences of street co-naming bring back some of the city’s warmest, happiest, hardest, or darkest past into the present, and manifest them at the intersections illuminating us where to go.

This website showcases NYC honorific street names established in 2002, 2011, and 2021, to provide a miniature of the nearly 30 years’ NYC Street Co-naming administered by the City Council.
